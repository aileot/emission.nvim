# âœ¨ emission.nvim

A fork of [tzachar/highlight-undo.nvim](https://github/tzachar/highlight-undo.nvim).

Highlight added/removed texts in current buffer, anywhere, anytime, as well as
undo/redo.
You can filter the highlight occasions by changed text length, Vim's mode,
etc.

Note: Unlike `highlight-undo.nvim` does, `emission.nvim` does not let you
alter `hlgroup`s for undo/redo, but only for added/removed.
